Project 1: Tarot Style Game

Background: Tarot cards date back to mid 15th- century Europe. There are many different types of tarot but this game is loosely based off of the mainstream Rider-Waite deck which was published back in 1910.

The games is loosely based off a “daily card” pull where you choose a card usually every morning (or sometimes at the end of the day) to help guide you through your day or just to provoke deeper thought and self exploration. I do not plan on using all the cards in the Rider-Waite deck. Instead I want to focus on the 22 major arcana cards that are said to highlight important/crucial aspects of every situation. These are perfect to use daily cards because with such a general meaning we can think about how each card may effect individual goals and aspirations for the day. 

Upon Load: When the player loads the game they are taken to a screen with the title of the game (Yet to be decided) centered in a header at the top of the page followed by a sub header with a tag line for the game or just a phrase of encouragement.

The center of the page is empty but down at the bottom theres a row of cards spread out but you can’t tell what the cards are. There’s a button underneath them that says “Choose Your Daily Card”.

Upon Click: When the player clicks on the “Choose Your Daily Card” button the cards on the bottom of the page disappear then a single card is brought to the empty space in the center of the screen and flipped around. It displays the players daily card and a snippet of what the card can be interpreted as/ where it might be helpful in life floats underneath.

There is no score to keep track of in this “game” and it is not timed. Its purpose it to provoke thought and conversation surrounding mental health and wellness.
